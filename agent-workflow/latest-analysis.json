      "title": "Create Google Colab notebook with GUI for rclone Google Drive transfers",
      "body": "## Overview\n\nThis PR implements a complete, self-contained Google Colab notebook that provides a simple graphical user interface for transferring files between Google Drive remotes using rclone. The solution is designed for non-technical users and handles all setup, configuration, and execution through interactive widgets.\n\n## üöÄ Key Features Added\n\n### 1. **Complete Jupyter Notebook** (`rclone_gdrive_transfer.ipynb`)\n- **Setup Cell**: Automatically installs rclone and ipywidgets, enables Colab widget support\n- **Step 1 - Configuration UI**: File upload widget for rclone.conf with validation and status feedback\n- **Step 2 - Transfer Setup UI**: Comprehensive configuration interface including:\n  - Source and destination path inputs with helpful placeholders\n  - Radio button selection for transfer modes (Server-Side vs Local)\n  - Checkbox options for common rclone flags (--dry-run, --fast-list, --verbose)\n  - Sliders for performance tuning (transfers and checkers)\n- **Step 3 - Execute & Monitor**: Start/stop buttons with real-time output and progress monitoring\n\n### 2. **Enhanced Documentation** (`README.md`)\n- Complete project description with feature highlights\n- Step-by-step getting started guide with Google Colab integration\n- Detailed rclone.conf creation instructions for all platforms\n- Transfer modes explanation (Server-Side vs Local)\n- Comprehensive troubleshooting section\n- Direct \"Open in Colab\" badge for easy access\n\n## üéØ User Experience\n\nThe notebook provides a seamless workflow:\n\n1. **One-click setup** - Single cell execution installs all dependencies\n2. **Drag & drop config** - Simple file upload for rclone.conf\n3. **Visual configuration** - Interactive widgets eliminate command-line complexity\n4. **Real-time monitoring** - Live progress updates during transfers\n5. **Error handling** - Comprehensive validation and helpful error messages\n\n## üîß Technical Implementation\n\n### Transfer Modes\n- **Server-Side Transfer** (Default): Uses `--drive-server-side-across-configs=true` for direct Google-to-Google transfers\n- **Local Transfer**: Routes through Colab VM when server-side isn't available\n\n### Robust Error Handling\n- Configuration file validation\n- Input sanitization and validation\n- Process management with proper cleanup\n- User-friendly error messages\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- Configurable parallel transfers (1-32)\n- Adjustable checker threads (1-64)\n- Progress reporting with statistics\n\n## üì± Example Usage\n\n```python\n# After running setup cell:\n# 1. Upload rclone.conf via file widget\n# 2. Configure paths:\nsource_input.value = \"source_drive:Documents/\"\ndestination_input.value = \"backup_drive:Backup/\"\n# 3. Click \"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Transfer\"\n```\n\n## üß™ Testing\n\nAll core functionality has been validated:\n- ‚úÖ Widget imports and creation\n- ‚úÖ File upload and processing\n- ‚úÖ Command building and validation\n- ‚úÖ Threading and subprocess execution\n- ‚úÖ Configuration directory handling\n\n## üìö Documentation\n\nThe README now includes:\n- Clear project overview with emojis for better readability\n- Platform-specific rclone installation instructions\n- Detailed rclone.conf setup guide\n- Transfer mode comparisons\n- Troubleshooting tips and common solutions\n\nThis implementation provides a complete, user-friendly solution for Google Drive transfers that requires zero technical knowledge from end users.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\nüí° You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
